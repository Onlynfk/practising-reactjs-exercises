    <li>Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there</li>
    <li>Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component</li>
    <li>Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)</li>
    <li>Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event</li>
    <li>Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput</li>
    <li>Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username</li>

  </ol>


  <!-- assignemt 2 -->
  <ol>
    <li>Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).</li>
    <li>Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop</li>
    <li>Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length)</li>
    <li>Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).</li>
    <li>Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.</li>
    <li>When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.</li>
  </ol>
